## Background

The FIFA video game seriesâ€”transitioning to **EA FC** provides a rich, consistent snapshot of footballers attributes over time. This project scrapes and analyzes SoFIFA player data from **FIFA 12 to FC 25 (2012â€“2024)**, with a focus on the **Top-5 European leagues** (*Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1*). It demonstrates practical data science skills: scraping, cleaning, feature engineering, analysis, and storytelling via dashboards.

## Objectives

**Who to Buy**
Identify high-potential, cost-effective players using metrics such as:

* Potential rating growth
* **Value-to-wage ratio**
* Trajectory across FIFA editions (form consistency, attribute deltas)

**Whoâ€™s the Best**
Rank top performers and durable stars by:

* Overall rating and key attributes (pace, dribbling, defending, etc.)
* Career longevity and consistency

**Player Value**
Study the relationship between market value and performance by:

* Age, position, league
* Macro trends (inflation, edition-to-edition shifts)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.9+**
* **Google Chrome** (latest) and a matching **ChromeDriver**
* (Optional) **JupyterLab** for notebooks, **Tableau/Power BI** for dashboards

### Installation

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fifa-players-analysis.git
cd fifa-players-analysis

# Base dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional (for notebook + visuals)
pip install jupyterlab numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

> **Tip:** Consider locking versions with a pinned requirements file for reproducibility.

### Run the Scraper

```bash
python fifa_scrape.py
```

**Default:** Scrapes top 100 players for **FC 25**, saving to `fifa_players_fc_25.csv`.

### Combine CSVs

```bash
python fifa_players_2012_2025_csv.py
```

Produces `fifa_players_2012_2025.csv` in the project root.

### Process & Analyze

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Open `Data Processing, Transformation, Manipulation.ipynb` and run the cells to clean, transform, and analyze the combined dataset.

## Usage Details

### Scraping Options

Edit `main()` in **`fifa_scrape.py`** to control:

* `fifa_name`: A label (e.g., `"fifa_12"`, `"fc_25"`)
* `url`: SoFIFA list URL for the desired edition (see SoFIFA archive)
* `max_players`: Limit number of rows (e.g., `100`, `1000`)

**Example (FIFA 12):**

```python
fifa_name = "fifa_12"
url = "https://sofifa.com/players?r=120002&set=true"
max_players = 100
```

> **Ethical Scraping**: Respect SoFIFAâ€™s **Terms of Service** and `robots.txt`. Add delays (e.g., `time.sleep`), retries, and backoff to avoid excessive requests. Consider proxying responsibly. When in doubt, **use pre-scraped CSVs** instead.

### Combining Options

Place all per-edition CSVs (e.g., `fifa_players_fifa_12.csv`, `fifa_players_fc_25.csv`) in the repo root and run:

```bash
python fifa_players_2012_2025_csv.py
```

This script concatenates per-edition files and writes `fifa_players_2012_2025.csv`.

## Troubleshooting

**ChromeDriver version mismatch**

* Ensure ChromeDriver matches your Chrome version.
* On Windows, place `chromedriver.exe` on `PATH` or set an explicit path in the script.

**Blocked/Rate Limited**

* Reduce request frequency; add `time.sleep` between pages.
* Respect `robots.txt` and ToS. Consider using saved CSVs.

**Encoding/Locale issues**

* Use UTF-8 when reading/writing CSVs: `encoding="utf-8"`.
* Normalize currency symbols; parse numbers with `locale`/regex.

**Inconsistent columns across editions**

* Use a canonical schema and `reindex` missing columns with `NaN`.
* Keep a `columns_map` to rename fields consistently.
